# Extra Textures
This Godot 4 plugin adds in extra default textures. To quickly test them out, create a Sprite2D, click the button that says "empty" next to the texture slot, and select one of the new textures from the drop-down menu.
Here's a list of the currently available textures:
- Rectangle
- Checkerboard
- Circle
- Regular Polygon

These all come with a few parameters you can mess around with, such as color and resolution.
